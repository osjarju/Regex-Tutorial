# Title (Regular expression for matching properly formatted URLs)

This is a tutorial looking into the functionality of a regular expression used to match URLs.

## Summary

The regular expression ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$ is used to match URLs. It consists of optional groups for the protocol and additional path or query parameters, followed by groups for the domain name and top-level domain, and ends with an optional trailing slash. This expression can match a wide variety of URL formats, but may not cover all possible cases.

## Regex Components
The regex expression ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$ consists of several components that work together to match properly formatted URLs:

^ - Anchor to match the start of the string.

(https?:\/\/)? - Optional capture group that matches the protocol of the URL. The ? quantifier makes the "s" in "https" optional, so that the expression can match URLs that use either "http" or "https" as the protocol.

([\da-z\.-]+) - Capture group that matches the domain name of the URL. This includes any combination of letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.

\.([a-z\.]{2,6}) - Capture group that matches the top-level domain of the URL. This includes any combination of lowercase letters and dots, with a minimum length of 2 characters and a maximum length of 6 characters.

([\/\w \.-]*)* - Optional capture group that matches any additional path or query parameters in the URL. This includes any combination of forward slashes, letters, numbers, spaces, dots, hyphens, and underscores.

\/? - Optional forward slash at the end of the URL path.

$ - Anchor to match the end of the string.

Overall, the components of the expression work together to match URLs that are properly formatted and conform to the expected pattern. By capturing specific parts of the URL, such as the protocol, domain name, and top-level domain, the expression can be used to validate and filter URLs in various contexts.

### Anchors
This regex expression uses the forward slash (/) as an anchor for matching the path or query parameters in the URL. The forward slash is used to separate different parts of the URL, and the expression ([\/\w \.-]*)* matches zero or more occurrences of any characters that can appear in the path or query parameters.

The expression also uses the asterisk (*) quantifier, which allows for zero or more occurrences of the preceding group or character. This means that the expression can match URLs with or without additional path or query parameters.

### Quantifiers
The question mark (?) quantifier is used to make the protocol group https?:\/\/ optional. This means that the expression can match URLs with or without the protocol.

The plus sign (+) quantifier is used to match one or more occurrences of the characters in the group ([\da-z\.-]+). This group matches the domain name, which can consist of digits, lowercase letters, dots, and hyphens.

The curly braces ({}) quantifier is used to match a specific number of occurrences of the characters in the group ([a-z\.]{2,6}). This group matches the top-level domain (TLD), which is typically a two- to six-letter string such as ".com" or ".org".

The asterisk (*) quantifier is used to match zero or more occurrences of the characters in the group ([\/\w \.-]*). This group matches any additional path or query parameters that might be included in the URL.

The combination of the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) quantifiers at the end of the expression ([\/\w \.-]*)*\/? makes the entire path or query parameter group optional, meaning that the expression can match URLs with or without a trailing slash.

### OR Operator
The expression uses the OR operator to match variations in the protocol part of the URL. Specifically, the expression (https?:\/\/)? matches either "http://" or "https://", with the question mark (?) indicating that the "s" in "https" is optional.

The square brackets ([ ]) group is used to match a range of characters. For example, the expression [\da-z\.-] matches any digit, lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen character.

The vertical bar (|) operator is used to match either of two alternatives. For example, the expression (http|https) matches either "http" or "https".

The curly braces ({}) operator is used to match a specific number of occurrences of a character or group. For example, the expression [a-z\.]{2,6} matches any two to six lowercase letters or dots, which typically represent the top-level domain (TLD) of the URL.
### Character Classes
The square brackets ([ ]) character class is used to match a range of characters. For example, the expression [\da-z\.-] matches any digit, lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen character.

The \d shorthand character class is used to match any digit character.

The \w shorthand character class is used to match any word character, which includes digits, letters, and underscores.

The dot (.) character is used to match a literal dot, which is used to separate different parts of the URL such as the domain name and the TLD.

The forward slash (/) character is used to match the path or query parameters in the URL.

By this, the expression can match URLs with digits and letters in the domain name, as well as URLs with different path and query parameters. The dot character is used to match the literal dot, which is a common character in URLs, while the forward slash is used as an anchor for matching the path or query parameters.

### Flags
Overall, flags can be used to modify the behavior of regular expressions and make them more flexible and powerful. However, the expression ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$ does not require any flags to match URLs with a wide variety of formats and components.

### Grouping and Capturing
The first group (https?:\/\/)? captures the protocol part of the URL, including the optional "s" in "https".

The second group ([\da-z\.-]+) captures the domain name of the URL, which can include any combination of digits, lowercase letters, dots, and hyphens.

The third group ([a-z\.]{2,6}) captures the top-level domain (TLD) of the URL, which typically consists of two to six lowercase letters or dots.

The fourth group ([\/\w \.-]*)* captures the path or query parameters of the URL, which can include any combination of forward slashes, word characters, spaces, dots, and hyphens. This group is followed by an asterisk (*) to indicate that it can match zero or more occurrences of the group.

### Bracket Expressions
The [\da-z\.-] bracket expression matches any digit, lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen character. This expression is used to match the domain name of the URL, which can include any combination of these characters.

The [a-z\.] bracket expression matches any lowercase letter or dot character. This expression is used to match the TLD of the URL, which typically consists of two to six lowercase letters or dots.

The [\/\w \.-] bracket expression matches any forward slash, word character, space, dot, or hyphen character. This expression is used to match the path or query parameters of the URL, which can include any combination of these characters.

Overall, by using bracket expressions, the expression can match specific sets of characters in the URL and ensure that they conform to the expected format. For example, the expression can ensure that the TLD consists only of lowercase letters and dots, and that the path or query parameters do not include any unexpected characters. This can be useful for validating URLs and ensuring that they are properly formatted.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
This regex expression uses a greedy match to match the path or query parameters of the URL.

Specifically, the expression uses the * quantifier after the fourth capture group ([\/\w \.-]*) to match zero or more occurrences of the group. Because the * quantifier is greedy by default, it will match as many characters as possible while still allowing the rest of the expression to match.

This means that the fourth capture group will match the longest possible string of characters that satisfies the expression, which can include multiple forward slashes, words, spaces, dots, and hyphens. For example, if the URL includes a path such as /category1/product1/subcategory1, the fourth capture group will match the entire path, including all of the subdirectories.

By using a greedy match, the expression can capture the entire path or query parameters of the URL in a single capture group. 

### Boundaries
The ^ and $ anchors define the beginning and end of the string, respectively. This means that the expression will only match URLs that begin with http:// or https:// and end with an optional forward slash /.

The \b boundary matches a word boundary, which is a position between a word character (as defined by \w) and a non-word character. This boundary is used to ensure that the expression does not match URLs that are embedded within larger strings, such as example.com within www.example.com/page1.

The (https?:\/\/)? group uses the ? quantifier to match zero or one occurrences of the s character in https. This allows the expression to match URLs that use either http or https as the protocol.

Overall, by using boundaries, the expression can ensure that it matches URLs that are properly formatted and do not include unexpected characters. This can be useful in cases where the URLs are being used in a security-sensitive context, such as validating user input or filtering potentially malicious content.

### Back-references
Back-references allow a regular expression to match a repeated sequence of characters by referencing a previous capture group. For example, the expression (a+)\1 would match one or more occurrences of the letter "a" followed by the same sequence of characters that matched the first capture group.

However, the provided expression does not have any repeating patterns that need to be matched using back-references. Instead, each part of the expression is used to match a specific set of characters in the URL.

Overall, the absence of back-references in the expression does not affect its ability to match URLs that are properly formatted and conform to the expected pattern. Back-references are typically used in more complex regular expressions that involve repeating patterns or groups, but they are not necessary for all matching scenarios.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
The provided expression does not require look-ahead or look-behind assertions because it matches URLs in a straightforward manner. Instead of relying on complex pattern matching, the expression matches URLs by looking for specific characters and sequences of characters that are expected to be present in a properly formatted URL.

Overall, the absence of look-ahead and look-behind assertions in the expression does not affect its ability to match URLs that are properly formatted and conform to the expected pattern. Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are useful in more complex matching scenarios, but they are not required for all regular expression matches.
